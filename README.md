# New Rust Project Skeleton

Rust requires a few bits of setup. These are files that are fairly
helpful for that.

If you've not done so, you should install rust. the `./tools`
directory has scripts that can help.

* *`rustup_install.sh`* is a copy of the rustup setup script, taken
  from `curl https://sh.rustup.rs`.

* *`rust_setup.sh`* updates rust. It also has comments which can
  include other very helpful modules like clippy and wasm.
